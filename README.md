# SP++

Requirements:
- A jailbroken iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch.
  - (Devices with 3.5" displays will look the best)
- A sync cable for your device. (30-Pin Dock Connector or Lightning Connector)
- A Mac or PC with some sort of way to transfer files to and from the device. (iExplorer, iFunBox, SSH, etc...)
- Dreamboard installed on your device.


Compatibility: 
SP++ has been tested on iOS 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10, but should be working on all other iOS versions that support Dreamboard.

SP++ has been optimized for 3.5" devices only, but with the resolution from one of these devices is set on a device with a larger screen, it should look normal.

SP++ works best on iPhone's/iPod's, but can be used on iPad's as well.  In order to make it look somewhat normal, the resolution would have be heavily adjusted.

Best devices to install SP++ on:
- iPhone 3G
- iPhone 3GS
- iPhone 4
- iPhone 4s
- iPod Touch 2nd Generation
- iPod Touch 3rd Generation
- iPod Touch 4th Generation

With a resolution change, it should also work nicely on:
- iPhone 5
- iPhone 5c
- iPhone 5s
- iPhone SE
- iPod Touch 5th Generation
- iPod Touch 6th Generation


How to install:
1. Connect your device to your computer and start up the software you will be transferring the files with. (iExplorer, iFunBox, SSH, etc...)
2. Navigate to the root of the filesystem and open the 'Dreamboard' folder.
3. Take the folder called 'SP++' that you got from the zip file and place it in there. Make sure not to put in the zip file. It will not work and could potentially prevent Dreamboard from working properly.



Now you can tap on the Dreamboard icon from your Springboard and you should see SP++ show up.  Click on it and SP++ will launch.

If it gets stuck on preparing theme for more than 2-3 minutes. The files have not been installed correctly. 
As long as you have followed the instructions properly, this should not happen. If somehow it does, you can leave an issue under the Issues tab and I will try to help you.
